# funLIFE: an automated genome mining tool for identification of lifestyle associated genes

funLIFE is a streamlined computational workflow that annotates fungal genomes and performs large-scale comparative genomics to predict fungal lifestyles and to pinpoint candidate genes, denominated  **lifestyle-associated genes (LAGs)**, and biosynthetic gene clusters associated with each lifestyle detected. This whole process is divided into different modules:

- **Clustering module**
	Predicts, clusters and annotates the genes of every input genome
- **Lifestyle prediction**
	Employs a machine learning model to forecast fungal lifestyle or other specified metadata
- **Analitical module (Shiny app)**
	Results from the previous modules are embedded in a user-friendly interface for comprehensive and interactive comparative genomics.
